# Variational_Auto_Encoder
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models.
When using generative models, you could simply want to generate a random, new output, that looks similar to the training data, and you can certainly do that too with VAEs. But more often, youâ€™d like to alter, or explore variations on data you already have, and not just in a random way either, but in a desired, specific direction
